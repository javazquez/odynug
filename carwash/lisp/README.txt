Subject: [dynamic_omaha] carwash code

Hi all,

Here's the lisp carwash code, as promised.  carwash.el is my first version, requirement 1 only, while carwash.lisp is the version presented last night.  carwash.el is written in emacs lisp and carwash.lisp is written in common lisp.

Here's a link to an online book about lisp: http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/index.html

Here's another link for lisp: http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Programming:Common_Lisp

Here's a reference link for lisp: http://www.cs.cmu.edu/Groups/AI/html/cltl/clm/index.html

Later,
Ben
