In order to run the code in here the ebin directory will need to be on your
Erlang search path.  To do that, put a file called .erlang in your home
directory with the following contents:

  io:format("consulting .erlang in ~p~n", [element(2,file:get_cwd())]).
  code:add_pathz("/path/to/carwash/erlang/ebin").

The Rakefile just runs "erl -run make" which uses the Emakefile to build the
Erlang source.  If you don't have Ruby, you should get it, but if you can't you
can just run the command on its own.
